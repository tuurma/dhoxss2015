        <note>Robert von Ranke Graves (248) was born 24 July 1895 in Wimbledon, London, England, and died 7 Dec. 1985 in Deya, Majorca. 
            He was Capt. RWF and a renowned poet, novelist, mythographer, critic and historian.
            Probably best known as the author of <title>I,Claudius</title>, and <title>Claudius the God</title> and as a survivor and
            poet of the Great War, he is one of the great figures of 20th Century English Poetry.
            He first married Annie Mary Prydie ("Nancy") Nicholson, daughter of William Nicholson, the artist, on 23 Jan. 1918 in St. James, Piccadilly.  
            She was born 13 Sept. 1899 and died in 1977. Nancy refused to change her name on marriage and insisted the girls born of the union keep her surname. 
            He then married Beryl née  Prichard, (divorced from  Hodge and who changed her name by deed-pole to Graves on 25 June 1943), on 12 May 1950, at the British Consulate in Palma. 
            She was born 22 Feb 1915 and died 27 October 2003.</note>

        <note>He was born Karl Goldschmidt in Germany, in 1912. He trained as a graphic artist
            but left his native country in 1933 on Hitler's rise to power. 
            1934 found him in Dey, Majorca, where the poets Robert Graves and Laura Riding
            befriended the intelligent young man. He learnt English (reading Defoe) and was
            soon helping with their Seizin Press and their typing, and wrote amusingly in Focus, their magazine.
            At the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, all three left Majorca on a Royal Navy destroyer.
            Graves persuaded the ship's captain not to transfer Goldschmidt to a German ship, and back to Germany,
            conscious of the fate that would, as a Jew, await him.
            In England Goldschmidt obtained leave to stay and work and, when the Second World War broke out,
            he gallantly served first in the Pioneer Corps, and later in the Royal Navy.
            In the Pioneers - as a protection in case of capture - he had been made to change his name.
            He became known (though he was always called Karl by his friends) as Kenneth Gay.
            When the war was over, he was granted full British citizenship.</note>
