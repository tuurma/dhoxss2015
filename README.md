##  St. John's College Robert Graves Trust

Robert Graves (1895-1985) was a poet, novelist, mythographer, critic and historian. Probably best known as the author of I,Claudius, and Claudius the God and as a survivor and poet of the Great War, he is one of the great figures of 20th Century English Poetry and Literature. Graves was an alumnus of St John's College, he resided there when he was elected to the Chair of Poetry at Oxford and was later elected an Honorary Fellow.

The St. John's College Robert Graves Trust was formed in 1994 and is registered as United Kingdom Charity no. 1021452. The aim of the Trust is to act as a clearing house for projects, studies and theses on Robert Graves' life and works and to provide means to enable this. To this end it:

  *Promotes the integrated cataloguing of letters, manuscripts, recordings, photographs and other extant Gravesiana in institutions in Britain, America and elsewhere so that interested persons can determine where and what material is available.
  *Locates manuscripts and letters still in private hands and ensure their safe keeping and preservation. The Trust is happy to advise holders, wishing to sell, on reputable establishments, willing to buy. However, the Trust is also happy to accept donations to augment the already important collection of Robert Graves correspondence which is housed in the St John"s Library where it is looked after by professional archivists. It is hoped, eventually, that the Trust will hold information (as a text, copy or even the original) for every extant letter Graves wrote. Provide resources for anyone researching, studying, teaching or simply enjoying Graves.

The setlor of the Trust was William Graves, Robert Gravesâ€™s executor, with the aim of providing a repository for Robert Graves"s papers, and of encouraging Graves studies.

*For the purpose of the Leveraging the TEI workshop of the Digital Humanities @Oxford Summer School, the Trust granted a permission to use a small selection of ca 20 letters from Robert Graves to his son, William Graves as a teaching material.
