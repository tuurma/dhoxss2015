                <p> I'm glad you managed to shift lodgings in good time: these occasions require
                    tact, &amp; the sooner the better! </p>
                <p> There is the third thunder<del>torme</del>
                    <add>storm</add> in four days now in progress; 11 a.m. Everything wet &amp;
                    grey, &amp; <rs ref="#GravesBeryl">Mother</rs> is poised over the AGa, which
                    makes the most wonderful sausage rolls in Christendom — Jews &amp; Moslems of
                    course aren't allowed to compete.</p>
                <p>
                    <persName ref="#ReidAlastair">Alastair</persName> and <persName>Mary</persName>
                    went off yesterday to <placeName ref="#Gibralter">Gibraltar</placeName> to catch
                    the <emph>Don Quijote del Mar </emph>&amp; will write to us from the
                        <del>Azo</del>
                    <gap reason="blot"/>
                    <placeName ref="#CanaryIslands">Canaries</placeName> &amp; <placeName ref="#Antigua">Antigua</placeName>. We have been teasing them about their
                    lack of fresh vegetables and fruit <add>and steaks</add> in the 40 days between
                    the two islands.</p>
                <p> There is no such word as <sic>imposible</sic> (except in Spanish <del>**</del>
                    <add>which</add> leaves out the first s.) <persName>Alan</persName>'s novel is
                    terrifically good and having deservedly <del>**good</del> long reviews; I'm
                    trying to make <orgName>Doubleday</orgName> publish it in <placeName>New
                        York</placeName>.</p>
                <p> Nice farewell lunch at the <emph>Triton</emph> to <persName ref="#ReidAlastair">Alastair</persName> &amp; <persName>Mary</persName>; wish you had been
                    there to compete among the gambas &amp; <foreign xml:lang="spa">paella</foreign>.</p>
                <p> I have sent my <title>Minorca</title> piece to <emph>Holiday</emph>. If they
                    take it you can buy yourself a box of cigars at my expense. Meanwhile try
                    smoking small Jamaican cigars, and only after a meal. Better for health than
                    cigarettes or pipe.</p>
                <p> The Broadway producer did not turn up. May have been because my U.S. agent gave
                    him the <orgName>Guillermo Massot </orgName>phone number like a bloody fool,
                    &amp; he rang ineffectually day after day. I don't know.</p>
                <p> Four more books of the <title>Iliad</title> only.</p>
                <p> We had all those hide-&amp;-seek bushes behind the oleanders removed; it leaves
                    a lot of space for more fruitbushes.</p>
                <p>
                    <persName>Patrick</persName> got out news of Pope's death one minute before
                    nearest British rival, and 10 minutes before the Americans.</p>
                <p>
                    <rs ref="GravesBeryl">Mother</rs> and I agree that you should break the winter
                    with a ski holiday. If <persName>Jenny</persName> &amp;
                        <persName>Patrick</persName> can't afford one themselves, you had better
                    join some group. Its a pity you need ski-lifts because there is money in
                        <placeName ref="#Yugoslavia">Yugland</placeName>; but perhaps another year.
                    Anyhow you will have it. God what thunder! no more bathing this year, it seems. </p>
