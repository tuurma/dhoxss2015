                <p>Back from <placeName ref="#Geneva">Geneva</placeName>, where we had a very good
                    time with the <persName>Foggs</persName>, who have a nice suburban house, garden
                    and poodle puppy. <emph rend="underlined">And</emph> car. They took us to see
                    the snow; and to see an <emph rend="underlined">estriptiz</emph> show, where 35
                    girls went through the same formula about as mechanically as most bullfighters
                    fight their bulls....We brought back <del>lost</del> lots of food and warm
                    clothes and pots and pans for the AGA; no trouble with the customs, because they
                    had never seen a hula-hula hoop before and <persName>Diana</persName> showed
                    them how. <del>Have</del>
                    <add place="above">We have</add> built a coke shed, and I have at last a fire
                    which doesn't smoke in my work room. Still very warm here.</p>
                <p>Will go and raise stink about your gloves: yes, sir! My leather jacket is
                    splendid.</p>
                <p>Of course, the installing of oneself <emph rend="underlined">is</emph> expensive;
                    so let us know how the <add place="margin">monthly</add> budget works out when
                    you have all that is needed.. &amp; I'll not let you down...Meanwhile, you have
                    enough solvency I hope. If not, let me know how much and I'll send.</p>
                <p rend="rotate">No news about <emph rend="underlined">
                        <title>Claudius</title>
                    </emph> of late, but the Broadway musical seems a serious proposition &amp;

                <p>Have you seen the French magazine called <title>SONORAMA</title> which is made of
                    records - comes out at 500fr for a month. Rather like a newsreel.</p>
                <p>Yes, by all means get the anti-polio injections offered you. <persName ref="#GravesLucia">Lucia</persName> and 
                    <persName ref="#GravesJuan">Juan</persName> are having them too. But you must be in good health at the
