            </opener>
            <p>I hope all is well in <placeName ref="#London">London</placeName><del>a</del> and that the Land-Rover is behaving itself. Our
            new one is marvellous and so quiet and comfortable - I do hope you will like it. The
            colour is not bad - very pale green, and the roof is white inside and the upholstery
            grey. </p>
            <p>I am sorry to have to tell you that <persName>Betty</persName> and <persName>Ricardo</persName> have given up the mine. Their
            partner, whom they had known and trusted for ten years and who had a joint bank account
            with them, went off with $30,000 which was all the money they had put into it. So that
            was that. Any other ideas for the summer?</p>

            </p>
            <p>Can't think of any other news. Love to <persName>Mike</persName> and <persName>Sheila</persName> if you see them - I was sorry we
            weren't able to get to the <placeName>Troubadour</placeName>.</p>

               kept at about 60-70 k.p.h on the Narbonne road. Little French cars shot by us, and
