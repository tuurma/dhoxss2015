            <p> Good luck in your interview [*]. If you are wholly at your ease - and why not? - all
                will go well. But try to raise some sort of enthusiasm for your proposed career:
                dont-care-ism doesn't go down well. </p>
            <p> There's never been so wet a <date>November</date> since - since last time - but we
                have had about three sunny days, and I even bathed three days ago at <placeName ref="#CanFloque">Can Floque</placeName>. The best news is getting 3 bottles of
                butagaz smuggled from <placeName ref="#France">France</placeName>, which means no
                more dirty carbon in the kitchen until the supply gives out. </p>
            <p> We hope to spend a few days in <placeName ref="#Austria">Austria</placeName> with
                    <persName ref="#NicholsonJenny">Jenny</persName> on the way to <placeName ref="#Yugoslavia">Jugland</placeName>, but she is all snarled up with the
                    <persName ref="#BevanAneurin">Bevan</persName> libel case (on November 21st)
                &amp; doesn't answer letters [**]. She was very nice to <persName ref="#GravesLucia">Lucia</persName> and <persName ref="#GravesJuan">Juan</persName> on the way
                through. </p>
            <p> I expect my <title>Goodbye To All That</title> will create a stir again as it did in
                    <date>1929</date> when it first came out - <placeName ref="#Canellun">Canellun</placeName> was built on the spoils. The <pb facs="WG.57.11.15.b.jpg"/>
                <title>Sunday Express</title> reviewer cabled could he fly out &amp; interview me. I
                cabled "yes: but you'll have to come out to <placeName ref="#Deia">Deya</placeName>", &amp; that's the last I've heard. The pups are eating raw meat
                now &amp; are very large &amp; fat &amp; active; <persName ref="#GravesBeryl">Mother</persName> spends most of her time trying to make them make little

                <persName>Castor</persName> is trimming the trees in the garden; the oranges nearly
                ripe. The stupid lilac thinks it is spring &amp; is flowering like the pear tree.
                Did you hear about <persName ref="#Ann">Ann</persName>'s dream when she was (in real
                life not dream) crippled with a slipped disk and in agony, &amp; the doctor kept
                ineffectually injecting her with anaesthetics. In the dream a woman said: "I have a
                wonderful recipe for you downstairs, come and try it!" She crawled out of bed, fell
                downstairs, &amp; somehow in her fall slipped the disk back. Now she's as right as
                rain. <persName ref="#ReidAlastair">Alastair</persName>'s address is: <placeName ref="#BellRockHouse">Bell Rock House St Andrews Fife</placeName>. He's writing a
                novel there. </p>

                    Can't you arrange the driving test when you get back? Just let me know as soon
