            <p>-<placeName ref="#Deia">Deya</placeName>, <date>Nov 10th 1958</date>-
            <lb/>Dear <persName ref="#GravesWilliam">William</persName>, <persName ref="#ReidAlastair">Alastair</persName>'s address at his next port of call is: Don
            <lb/>Quixote del Mar, C/O Commander Nicholson, English Harbour, Antigua, British 
            <lb/>West Indies[*]. I don't know how long it will take him to get to <placeName ref="#NewYork">New York</placeName> 
            <lb/>but you can get him in New York   C/O Jess McNab, 86 Horatio Street, N.Y.C.14</p>
            <p>With any luck you should get your sobrasada soon as the Pickstones 
            <lb/>know someone who is driving back to <placeName ref="#England">England</placeName> this week and I have given them 
            <lb/>one to give him. If he takes it he will leave it with the Bevans's - people 
            <lb/>we used to know in <placeName ref="#Barcelona">Barcelona</placeName> and met again soon after you left for <placeName ref="#London">London</placeName>. 
            <lb/>He, Bernard Bevan is mentioned in the great mushroom book, and in 
            <lb/>fact he was one of the first people to go to the Mexican tribe which 
            <lb/>Wasson later wrote about. The joke was he didn't know that he was in the 
            <lb/>book until he called on us at the very moment when we had that book on the 
            <lb/>table and were showing it to <persName ref="#ReidAlastair">Alastair</persName>'s friend Alastair. Their address 
            <lb/>is: 35, Elm Park Gardens, S.W.10. FLAX 4256. and this man who is taking the 
            <lb/>sobrasada lives opposite them and will leave it with them - that is of 
            <lb/>course, if the Pickstones find him to give it to him! I have put your 
            <lb/>address on the packet so the <persName ref="#AneurinBevan">Bevan</persName>'s will probably get in touch with you if 
            <lb/>etc.</p>
            <p>Will see Pedro about the gloves today, and will post them as soon as. 
            <lb/>Also the guitar things.</p>
            <p>Juan has started his O level this month. <persName>Selby</persName> has left the school, 
            <lb/>in fact he was asked not to return, and poor <persName>Abdullah</persName> has been expelled 
            <lb/>as he found it impossible to conform to school rules and also give up 
            <lb/>smoking[**]. By the way, did you ever get a pipe?</p>
            <p>No more news, and I'm getting cold sitting here, typing!</p>
            <p>Love from us all,</p>
            <p>
                <signatures>Mother</signatures>
            </p>
            <p>Margins:  Sorry to say I've just worked through your letters and can find 
            <lb/>no mention of what you wanted for your guitar. Did I dream it or was it on 
            <lb/>an envelope. Send a p.c. saying what &amp; I'll airmail it.</p>
