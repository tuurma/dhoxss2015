            <p>Season of colds and coughs; I've had mine, <rs ref="#GravesBeryl">Mother</rs> is still wrestling with hers, Tom√°s
            can't make up his mind. The barometer dropped to nearly zero and o the storm and
            rain!</p>
            <p>Meanwhile we had the four little <persName>Weedons</persName> in the house until <persName>Tom</persName> died <date>last Monday</date>,
            painlessly after a long coma. Everyone behaved beautifully: <persName>Rovira</persName> persuaded the priest
            to allow him burial in a Catholic cemetery &amp; the whole village went up to view the
            difunto &amp; bring flowers &amp; escort him with candles to the cemetery a 1/2 of an
            hour away, where the Lord's prayer was said, &amp; all walked away silently.</p>
            <p>The only awful character was <persName>Polimani</persName> who refused to enter the house, and only sent a
            bill for 16 pesetas for 2 kilos of oranges; afterwards complained that the heater
            borrowed by <persName>Veronica</persName> for <persName>Tom</persName> was broken and must be repaired at her expense - but it was
            only his plug that was wrong!</p>
            <p>Somebody offered to sell his grandmother's grave and dispose of her elsewhere, but <persName>V.</persName>
            didn't like the headstone, so is making other arrangements.</p>
            <p> The child who felt the death worst was <persName>Fiona</persName> the youngest. Now they have all gone back
            but <persName>V.</persName> is worn to a rag by a fortnight of almost no sleep. We are buying them a poodle
            puppy to restore morale.</p>
            <p>"Apparently" had two ps; I do wish you had learned to read English before Spanish - our
            fault!</p>

            <note><persName>Ava</persName> sent me a pink tie from Rome hoping it found me in the pink! </note>
            <postscript>
                <p>I'll try to get the <persName>Valldemosa</persName>'s address on my way to <placeName ref="#Palma">Palma</placeName> tomorrow, if we survive
               until then, and enclose it. These dates are more or less: come to <placeName ref="#London">London</placeName> about the
               8th or 9th &amp; <persName>R.</persName> goes to <placeName ref="#NewYork">N.Y.</placeName> <date>15th</date> &amp; <persName>T</persName> &amp;
